# Events calendar
A list of available and reserved slots for satRdays so that we can keep track of what's happening around the world. Our events and this repo are subject to our Code of Conduct which you can find alongside info on what the requirements are around running a satRday event on our [knowledge base](//knowledgebase.satrdays.org).

## Event scheduling
We're currently doing two new events per "region" per quarter to help ensure events can access a decent speaker and attendee pool. 

We'll be looking to up the frequency of events as we go and, of course, "rest of world" is pretty darn big so we can probably bust the limitation immediately if the demand to run events is there. 

We're currently aiming not to clash within region by running on the same months, so if someone in the quarter you're reserving or an annual event already has dibs on a month, try to avoid date clashes.

## Signing up
1. Read [What's involved](https://knowledgebase.satrdays.org/newevents/) with running an event and what rules / principles you'll need to adhere to
2. Get the ball rolling on reserving an event slot by submitting a Pull Request of this page with this info added into the relevant section:

If you would like a hand on submitting a pull request, or want to chat about running an event, join us on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rusergroups/shared_invite/enQtMjEyNDA3MzcyMjczLTE3NWEzNjQ3MjZiMWM0OGE2ZWFiZDliNTY4NTJjYWY1NGNjMmNlNDUzNzkzOTZmMDBjYjRiZjFhNjk4MDY0ZGY)

## SatRdays that (can) run on an annual basis
These are satRdays organiser groups / locations that have already run a satRday and are looking to continue running on an annual basis. By folks running annual events and us increasing the number of new events, we will be growing the number of events taking place each year dramatically.
